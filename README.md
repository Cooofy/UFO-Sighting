# UFO-Sighting Analysis

### Overview of Project
Creating a new webpage to allow users to to search UFO sightings all around the US and narrowing searches with certain filters.

### Results
With the pictures below you can see that you are able not just use one filter but multiple if you wish.

### Summary
One of things we can do to improve the website would be adding an addtional filter called Duration. We can set groups such as under five minutes, more then 10 minutes so if users want to look up sightings based on duration instead of scrolling down the whole list. Another recommendation would be adusting the filters so that if a user inputs capital letters in the filters it will still search for sighting if there is a match.
